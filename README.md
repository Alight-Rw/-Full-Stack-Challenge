# Alight Full-Stack-Challenge


# Task Force FullStack Challenge (Javascript/Typescript)

* Create a full web application using the following stacks,
  Back-end: Use any Javascript or Type Javascript framework/library you are comfortable with (or any technology).
  Front-end: Use any front-end framework/library you are most comfortable with.

* In this challenge, you have the flexibility to choose whether to work on the frontend, the backend, or both.
